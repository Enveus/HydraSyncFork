# Project Progress: SyncBot

## Current Status
SyncBot has been completely restructured with a modular architecture. The codebase is now more maintainable and ready for future features like a UI dashboard.

## What Works

### Core Functionality
- ✅ Regular SyncBot mode (main server → synced servers)
- ✅ Reverse SyncBot mode (synced servers → main server)
- ✅ Slash command registration
- ✅ Role synchronization on manual role changes
- ✅ Role synchronization on server join/leave events
- ✅ Permission system for command usage
- ✅ Logging system for tracking operations
- ✅ Automatic role checking when a user joins the Main Server
- ✅ Smart role removal when a user is kicked from a Synced Server

### Commands
- ✅ `/add` - Add a role to a user across servers
- ✅ `/remove` - Remove a role from a user across servers
- ✅ `/role-checker` - Analyze and optionally force-sync roles (now includes errors in a separate text file)

### Event Handling
- ✅ Role addition/removal detection
- ✅ Server join/leave detection
- ✅ Command interaction handling
- ✅ Intelligent role management that preserves roles if present in other synced servers

### Configuration
- ✅ External configuration via config.json
- ✅ Configuration validation on startup

## Completed Improvements

### Code Structure
- ✅ Created a more organized directory structure
- ✅ Refactored code into smaller, more focused modules
- ✅ Consolidated command registration logic
- ✅ Created a unified entry point for both modes
- ✅ Prepared for future UI dashboard integration
- ✅ Added .gitignore file for better version control (excluding config.json, .clinerules, and memory-bank/)

### Role Synchronization
- ✅ Implemented Sync ID-based role linking
- ✅ Added automatic role checking when users join the Main Server
- ✅ Enhanced role removal logic to check other synced servers before removing roles

### Previous Improvements
- ✅ Move permissions checks to application commands
- ✅ Make role-checker more performant
- ✅ Create Discord-formatted instructions for admins
- ✅ Implement Discord API best practices
- ✅ Refactor duplicate code between run.js and runReverse.js
- ✅ Improve error handling and reporting
- ✅ Add more comprehensive logging

## Planned Features
- ✅ Add configuration UI/dashboard prototype
- ✅ Implement Sync ID-based role linking functionality
- ✅ Create test plan for Sync ID-based role linking
- ✅ Create UI dashboard integration plan
- ✅ Integrate UI dashboard with Discord bot (Phase 1)
- ⚠️ Complete UI dashboard integration (Phase 2 & 3)
- ⚠️ Add role hierarchy awareness
- ⚠️ Add support for role permission synchronization
- ⚠️ Database integration for persistent storage

## Known Issues
- Role hierarchy can cause issues if the bot's role is lower than roles it tries to manage
- ✅ Performance issues with role-checker on large servers (resolved with batch processing)
- ✅ No handling for Discord API rate limits (resolved with rate limit handling)
- ⚠️ No persistent storage for configuration changes (requires database integration)
- ✅ Limited error recovery mechanisms (improved with comprehensive error handling)

## Next Steps
1. ✅ Implement Sync ID-based role linking functionality:
   - ✅ Update the configuration schema to include Sync IDs for roles
   - ✅ Modify role management utilities to handle Sync ID-based operations
   - ✅ Update event handlers to use Sync IDs for role synchronization
   - ✅ Enhance the UI to allow selection of Sync IDs for each role
2. Test the Sync ID-based role linking functionality:
   - Execute the test plan in memory-bank/test-plan.md
   - Document test results and fix any issues found
3. ✅ Integrate the UI dashboard with the Discord bot (Phase 1):
   - ✅ Update bot configuration system to load UI configuration
   - ✅ Create merged configuration object
   - ✅ Create API endpoints for server and role information
   - ✅ Update CLI to support UI dashboard
4. Complete UI dashboard integration (Phase 2 & 3):
   - Implement authentication for the UI
   - Add real-time status updates via WebSockets
   - Implement advanced features (role hierarchy, permissions)
5. Add database integration for persistent storage

## UI Dashboard Implementation
We have implemented a prototype of the UI dashboard with the following features:

### Completed UI Features
- ✅ Web-based interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- ✅ Express.js server to serve the UI and handle API requests
- ✅ Mode selection between "Main → Many" or "Many to Main"
- ✅ Server management (add main server, add/remove synced servers)
- ✅ Role management (add/remove roles for each server)
- ✅ Configuration saving
- ✅ Mock API for development and testing
- ✅ Enhanced server cards with avatars and banners
- ✅ Improved visual layout with centered server names
- ✅ Added light grey background to X buttons for better visibility
- ✅ Vertically aligned server names with avatars for cleaner appearance
- ✅ Applied consistent styling to remove buttons for roles and servers

### Pending UI Features
- ✅ Sync ID selection for roles
- ✅ Integration with Discord bot API (Phase 1)
- ⚠️ Authentication and authorization
- ⚠️ Real-time synchronization status
- ⚠️ Audit logging of configuration changes

### UI Structure
```
src/web/
├── public/           # Static files
│   └── index.html    # Main HTML file
├── css/              # Stylesheets
│   └── styles.css    # Main CSS file
├── js/               # JavaScript files
│   ├── app.js        # Main application logic
│   └── api.js        # API communication module
├── server.js         # Express server
└── start.js          # Server startup script
```

### Running the UI
The UI can be started using the following npm scripts:
- `npm run ui`: Starts the UI server and opens it in the default browser
- `npm run ui:server`: Starts only the UI server without opening the browser
